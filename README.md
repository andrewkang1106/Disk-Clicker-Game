# Disk-Clicker-Game
This is a simple PApplet game where the user can gain points by simply clicking on moving disks with assigned point values.

## Motivation
This project was created as a course project with the objective of using PApplet to create a simple game.
RIP Prof. McIntosh.

## Screenshots
As shown in the pictures below, the user would be clicking on the disks within a time limit (top left, in seconds) to score points (on the right of the timer).
